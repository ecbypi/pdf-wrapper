= Overview

A PDF writing library that uses the cairo and pango libraries to do the heavy
lifting. I've essentially just wrapped these general purpose graphics libraries
with some sugar that makes them a little easier to use for making PDFs.

At this stage the API is roughly following that of PDF::Writer, but i've made 
tweaks in some places and added some new methods. This is a work in progress so
many features of PDF::Writer aren't available yet.

A key motivation for writing this library is cairo's support for Unicode in PDFs.
All text functions in this library support UTF8 input, although as a native 
English speaker I've only tested this a little, so any feedback is welcome. 

There also seems to be a lack of English documentation available for the ruby 
bindings to cairo/pango, so I'm aiming to document the code as much as possible
to provide worked examples for others. I'm learning as I go though, so if regular
users of either library spot techniques that fail best practice, please let me know.
