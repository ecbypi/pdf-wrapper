= Overview

PDF::Wrapper is a PDF generation library that uses the cairo and pango
libraries to do the heavy lifting. I've essentially just wrapped these general
purpose graphics libraries with some sugar that makes them a little easier to
use for making PDFs. The idea is to lever the low level tools in those libraries
(drawing shapes, laying out text, importing raster images, etc) to build some
higher level tools - tables, text boxes, borders, lists, repeating elements
(headers/footers), etc.

At this stage the API is *roughly* following that of PDF::Writer, but i've made 
tweaks in some places and added some new methods. This is a work in progress so
many features of PDF::Writer aren't available yet.

A key motivation for writing this library is cairo's support for Unicode in PDFs.
All text functions in this library support UTF8 input, although as a native 
English speaker I've only tested this a little, so any feedback is welcome. 

There also seems to be a lack of English documentation available for the ruby 
bindings to cairo/pango, so I'm aiming to document the code as much as possible
to provide worked examples for others. I'm learning as I go though, so if regular
users of either library spot techniques that fail best practice, please let me know.

It's early days, so the API is far from stable and I'm hesitant to write extensive 
documentation just yet. It's the price you pay for being an early adopter. The
examples/ dir should have a range of sample code, and I'll try to keep it up to
date.

I welcome all feedback, feature requests, patches and suggestions. In
particular, what high level widgets would you like to see? What do you use when
building reports and documents in GUI programs?

= Installation

The recommended installation method is via Rubygems.

  gem install pdf-wrapper

= Dependencies

* ruby/cairo[http://cairographics.org/rcairo/]
* ruby/pango[http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/] (optional, required to add text)
* ruby/rsvg2[http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/] (optional, required for SVG support)
* ruby/gdkpixbuf[http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/] (optional, required for GIF/JPG support)
* ruby/poppler[http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/] (optional, required embedding PDF images)

These are all ruby bindings to C libraries. On Debian/Ubuntu based systems
(which I develop on) you can get them by running:

    aptitude install libcairo-ruby libpango1-ruby librsvg2-ruby libpoppler-glib-ruby

For users of other systems, I'd love to receive info on how you set these bindings up.

ruby/cairo is also available as a gem (cairo), which may be installable if you have a copy
of the cairo source available on your system.

= Compatibility

JRuby users, you're probably out of luck. 

Rubinius users, I have no idea.

Ruby1.9 users, the current release of ruby/cairo (1.5.0) doesn't work with 1.9,
but the version in SVN does. Hopefully it will be released soon. The version in
Debian has been patched to work with 1.9 already. PDF::Wrapper itself is 1.9
compatible.
